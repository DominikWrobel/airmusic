the repository in to the folder `~/.homeassistant/custom_components/` where
you have your home assistant installation

The custom components directory is inside your Home Assistant configuration directory.

This is how your custom_components directory should be:
```bash
custom_components
├── airmusic
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── media_player.py
│   ├── manifest.json
│   └── airmusicapi.py
```
# Install with HACS recomended:
It is possible to add it as a custom repository.

If you are using HACS, go to HACS -> Integrations and click on the 3 dots (top righ corner).
Then choose custom repositories, and add this repository url (https://github.com/DominikWrobel/airmusic), choosing the Integration category.

That's it, and you will be notified by HACS on every release.
Just click on upgrade.

# Configuration Example:

Type in your radio IP and name

![Przechwytywanie](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1230d720-dd22-4cb6-b167-354f6f8eae47)

The Internet radios need to have static IP set up.

# Known problems with installation

  - At first installation the radio will receive init command, it may not work at first, try to turn on or off the radio and restart Home Assistant.
  - Do not use at the same time this integration and the AirMusic app or any other form of connecting to the radio via internet, it may cause the radio to freeze.

# Remote

I've added a simple remote at (https://github.com/DominikWrobel/airmusic/tree/main/remote) using shell_command and button cards. Remote can be used with or without this integration.
