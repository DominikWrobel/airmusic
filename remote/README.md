# Remote

Using shell_command.yaml which you add to your configuration.yaml and remote.yaml to copy to your dashboard you can have a sumple remote with button cards in vertical and horizontal stack. Make sure you change the IP adress and the media_player entity of the radio! This remote can be used with or without the airmusic integration!
